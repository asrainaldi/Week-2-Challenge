    | \*\*    | \*\*      | \*\*     | \*\*      | \*\*       |

* Populate the tables with dummy data
* Create an ERD Diagram to show the relationships between the tables
### Write queries for the following: 
    1. The most popular product sold on a specific date.
    2. The most popular product sold last week. 
    3. The most popular product sold on a specific month.
    
### Stretch Goals
    4. The most popular subcategory for a specific date.
    5. The most popular subcategory for last week.
    6. The most popular subcategory for a specific month.
## How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected it to take awhile since my SQL isn't strong so I started the work the night before.

## What went well?
I had working SQL queries.

## What didn't go as planned?
I misunderstood the detention of popularity and had made the queries more completed than intended while also not answering the question as intended.

## Possible improvements for future challenges
An example query showing the intention of the challenge.
